main.py = launch application.
base/ = codebase, the library itself. 
plugins/ or modules/ = planned folder for extensions to the regular codebase

base/network.py = network class, controls i/o with clients and the network server.
	* abstract input/output. It strips control chars and such, and passes lines directly to the client and the game.
base/game.py = game class, controls all the other classes. A 'manager' class.
	* game logic will probably not be here, but will be an inherited class of this. 

----

Next TODO-s:
	* ! client class for easy information access.
	* ! player class, parent to client class
	* + tile class, which contains player
	* - map tile (region) class, which contains a set of tiles in a particular 'region'
	* - world tile class, which contains regions in a particular 'world'

! - immediate
+ - follows
- - planned
