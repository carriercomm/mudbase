main.py = launch application.
/base/ = codebase, the library itself. 
/sql/ = sql databases
/plugins/ or /modules/ = planned folder for extensions to the regular codebase

base/network.py = network class, controls i/o with clients and the network server.
	* abstract input/output. It strips control chars and such, and passes lines directly to the client and the game.
base/game.py = game class, controls all the other classes. A 'manager' class.
	* game logic will probably not be here, but will be an inherited class of this. 
base/client.py = client class, controls i/o between client and game. Preprocessing, basically.
base/player.py = information about player. Names, characters, etc. Player =\= character. Those will be added eventually.
base/sql.py = SQL access middle-man.
base/map.py = holder for rooms, also spawner for them from db
base/room.py = room class, contains players

----

Next TODO-s:
	* ! proper exit/entry for rooms, proper movement inter-room
	* + character class, which defines a player's character in the world.
	* - region class, which contains a set of rooms in a particular 'region'
	* - world class, which contains regions in a particular 'world'

! - immediate
+ - follows
- - planned
